> A Bottlerocket bootstrap container for initializing ephemeral storage

**As of Bottlerocket v1.22.0, Bottlerocket can configure ephemeral storage using [Bootstrap commands](https://bottlerocket.dev/en/os/1.22.x/concepts/bootstrap-commands/#configure-ephemeral-disks).** You should probably use that instead of this bootstrap container.
